Planned Tools
------------------------------
My dataset is designed for a prediction task to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year. Instead of a prediction, I think I can see the characteristics of people who earns 50K or more versus less. Therefore, my visualization is to see a clustering in two groups based on income.

My packages would be:
- `GGally `
- `ggplot2`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `scales`
- `shiny`
- `tm`

Planned Techniques
------------------------------

Include a list of four different techniques you plan to implement, why you choose those techniques for your dataset, and what you hope to learn. You should have approximately 3 to 5 sentences per technique.

Keep in mind you will be asked to implement 1 to 2 prototypes for peer review.

Planned Interaction
------------------------------

Describe the types of interaction you want to include (filtering, brushing, zooming, panning, sorting, and so on). You can discuss this per technique or overall if you plan to integrate all of the techniques into a single `shiny` app.

Keep in mind you will be asked to implement at least one of your planned interactions along with your prototype.

Planned Interface
------------------------------

Draw an annotated sketch illustrating the interface you plan to create for your prototypes and interactions. You can draw this on paper and upload a scan, use the free Google Drive Drawing tool, or use any other tool that allows you to upload the result as a PDF.

This does not have to be anything fancy. Just enough to show you have thought about how you would like to bring everything together.
